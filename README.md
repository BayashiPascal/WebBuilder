To setup a minimal webpage based on WebBuilder:
* Copy the files in this repo
* Download jquery.min.js and add it to the JS folder
* Set the base url, email and database connection into PHP/WebBuilderConf.php and PHP/WebBuilderDBConf.php
* Access index.php, if everything works fine you should see the same page as the link below. If not don't hesitate to contact me !
